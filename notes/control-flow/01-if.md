# if Statement in Java

## What is an if Statement?

- The `if` statement is a **decision control statement**
- It is used to execute a block of code **only when a condition is true**
- The condition must evaluate to a **boolean value**

---

## Syntax

```java
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
```
## Example

```java
int age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("Eligible to vote");
}
```
## How it Works

- The condition inside the `if` statement is evaluated
- If the condition is **true**, the code block is executed
- If the condition is **false**, the code block is skipped

---

## Important Points

- Curly braces `{ }` are optional for a **single statement**, but recommended
- The condition must return a **boolean**
- Relational and logical operators are commonly used in conditions
