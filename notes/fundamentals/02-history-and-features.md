# History & Features of Java

## History of Java

- Java was developed by **James Gosling** and his team at **Sun Microsystems**
- Development started in **1991**
- Initially, Java was designed for **embedded systems**
- The original name of Java was **Oak**
- Oak was later renamed to **Java**
- The first public version of Java was released in **1995**
- In **2010**, Sun Microsystems was acquired by **Oracle**
- Java is currently maintained and developed by **Oracle**

## Why Java Was Created

Java was created to solve common problems found in earlier programming languages:
- Platform dependency
- Complex memory management
- Security issues
- Lack of portability

The main goal was:
- **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)**

---

## Features of Java

### 1. Simple
- Java syntax is easy to learn
- Removes complex features like pointers
- Automatic memory management using Garbage Collection

---

### 2. Object-Oriented
- Java follows object-oriented principles
- Supports concepts like:
    - Class
    - Object
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
    - Encapsulation
    - Abstraction

---

### 3. Platform Independent
- Java code is compiled into **bytecode**
- Bytecode runs on the **JVM**
- Same bytecode can run on different operating systems

---

### 4. Secure
- No direct memory access
- Bytecode verification
- Strong runtime security features

---

### 5. Robust
- Strong memory management
- Exception handling
- Type checking at compile time

---

### 6. Multithreaded
- Supports execution of multiple threads
- Helps in efficient CPU utilization
- Used in high-performance applications

---

### 7. High Performance
- Uses **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compiler
- Faster than traditional interpreted languages

---

### 8. Distributed
- Supports distributed applications
- Networking APIs available in Java

---

### 9. Portable
- Bytecode is platform independent
- Data types have fixed sizes

---

### 10. Interpreted
- Java is both **compiled and interpreted**
- Java source code is compiled into **bytecode**
- Bytecode is executed by the **JVM**
- JVM interprets the bytecode and executes it on the system

## Java Platforms

Java is divided into different platforms based on application needs:

### Java SE (Standard Edition)

- Core Java platform
- Used for:
    - Desktop applications
    - Standalone applications
    - Core backend logic
- Provides fundamental libraries and APIs

**Key Technologies:**
- Core Java (OOP, Collections, Exceptions)
- JDBC
- Multithreading
- I/O (File Handling)
- Networking
- JVM, JRE, JDK

---

### Java EE (Enterprise Edition) *(now Jakarta EE)*

- Built on top of Java SE
- Used for enterprise and web-based applications
- Designed for scalable, distributed systems

**Key Technologies:**
- Servlet
- JSP
- JSTL
- EJB
- JPA
- JMS
- Web Services (SOAP / REST)

---

### Java ME (Micro Edition)

### Java ME (Micro Edition)

- Designed for **resource-constrained devices**
- Used mainly in **feature phones**
- Commonly used in devices like:
    - Nokia phones
    - Phones running **Symbian OS**
- Not used for Android smartphones
- Also used in some embedded systems

**Key Technologies:**
- MIDP
- CLDC
- Embedded Java APIs
