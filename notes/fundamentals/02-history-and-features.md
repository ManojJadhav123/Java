# History & Features of Java

## History of Java

- Java was developed by **James Gosling** and his team at **Sun Microsystems**
- Development started in **1991**
- Initially, Java was designed for **embedded systems**
- The original name of Java was **Oak**
- Oak was later renamed to **Java**
- The first public version of Java was released in **1995**
- In **2010**, Sun Microsystems was acquired by **Oracle**
- Java is currently maintained and developed by **Oracle**

## Why Java Was Created

Java was created to solve common problems found in earlier programming languages:
- Platform dependency
- Complex memory management
- Security issues
- Lack of portability

The main goal was:
- **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)**

## Features of Java

### 1. Simple
- Java syntax is easy to learn
- Removes complex features like pointers
- Automatic memory management using Garbage Collection

---

### 2. Object-Oriented
- Java follows object-oriented principles
- Supports concepts like:
    - Class
    - Object
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
    - Encapsulation
    - Abstraction

---

### 3. Platform Independent
- Java code is compiled into **bytecode**
- Bytecode runs on the **JVM**
- Same bytecode can run on different operating systems

---

### 4. Secure
- No direct memory access
- Bytecode verification
- Strong runtime security features

---

### 5. Robust
- Strong memory management
- Exception handling
- Type checking at compile time

---

### 6. Multithreaded
- Supports execution of multiple threads
- Helps in efficient CPU utilization
- Used in high-performance applications

---

### 7. High Performance
- Uses **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compiler
- Faster than traditional interpreted languages

---

### 8. Distributed
- Supports distributed applications
- Networking APIs available in Java

---

### 9. Portable
- Bytecode is platform independent
- Data types have fixed sizes

---

### 10. Interpreted
- Java is both **compiled and interpreted**
- Java source code is compiled into **bytecode**
- Bytecode is executed by the **JVM**
- JVM interprets the bytecode and executes it on the system

## Key Takeaways

- Java was developed in the early 1990s
- Originally named Oak
- Maintained by Oracle
- Java is simple, secure, portable, and robust
- Designed for platform independence
